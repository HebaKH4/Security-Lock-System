# Security-Lock-System
A Flask-based website that offers remote control and monitoring for an Arduino Lock System (including its associated code). Using Socket.IO, it sends real-time updates on activation codes, security events, and logs. Redis securely stores activation codes, and users can send commands like turning off the buzzer, light, or updating passcodes.
